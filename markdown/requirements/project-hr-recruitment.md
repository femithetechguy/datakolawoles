### Business Requirements Document: Recruitment Analysis

**1. Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to establish a robust and scalable data architecture to support comprehensive recruitment analytics. This initiative will enable the business to gain valuable insights into the hiring process, from candidate sourcing to final placement.

**2. Data Modeling Requirement**
The foundational requirement for this project is the transformation of the raw data source into a structured analytical model.

* **Data Model:** The solution must migrate the source recruitment data, which is currently in a flat file format, into a star schema data model. This architecture is required to optimize data for reporting, ensure data integrity, and facilitate efficient querying for key business metrics.

**3. Key Analytical Capabilities**
Upon the successful implementation of the star schema, the data model must support the following key analytical requirements:

* **Time-to-Hire Analysis:** The ability to measure and report on the duration of the hiring process, from application to offer acceptance.
* **Source of Hire Analysis:** The capability to analyze which recruitment channels and sources are most effective in attracting candidates.
* **Recruitment Funnel Metrics:** The ability to visualize and analyze the candidate pipeline at each stage, identifying bottlenecks and areas for process improvement.
* **Cost-per-Hire Analysis:** The capability to report on the cost associated with hiring a new employee, segmented by various factors such as department or role.
* **Hiring Manager Performance:** Analysis of hiring manager efficiency and effectiveness in the recruitment process.
