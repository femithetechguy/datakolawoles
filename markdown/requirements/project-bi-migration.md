### Business Requirements Document: BI Platform Migration

**1. Objective**
The objective of this project is to execute a comprehensive migration of the organization's business intelligence platform from Tableau to Microsoft Power BI. This initiative aims to standardize reporting tools, enhance data accessibility, and leverage the integrated capabilities of the Power BI ecosystem.

**2. Scope**
The scope of this project includes the full transition of existing Tableau dashboards, data sources, and user access to the new Power BI environment.

**3. Key Requirements**
The successful completion of this migration requires the fulfillment of the following key requirements:

* **Assessment & Inventory:** Conduct a full inventory and a detailed assessment of all existing Tableau dashboards, reports, and data sources to determine the complexity and level of effort required for migration.
* **Dashboard Conversion:** Convert all identified Tableau dashboards to functionally equivalent reports and dashboards within the Power BI platform. All key visualizations, filters, and interactive elements must be replicated.
* **Data Source Migration:** Ensure a seamless transition of all underlying data connections and models from Tableau to Power BI.
* **Performance Validation:** Conduct rigorous performance testing and validation to ensure that all migrated reports and dashboards meet or exceed the performance of their Tableau counterparts.
* **User Training & Support:** Develop and execute a comprehensive training plan for end-users and analysts to ensure a smooth transition and adoption of the new Power BI platform.
* **Legacy Decommissioning:** Establish a formal plan and timeline for the phased decommissioning of the legacy Tableau environment upon successful migration and user adoption.
