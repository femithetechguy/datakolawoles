### Implementation Plan: Business Intelligence Solution

The development of the business intelligence solution will proceed through the following systematic implementation phases:

**Phase 1: Data Strategy and Analysis**

* **Data Source Assessment:** Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the source data to understand its structure, content, and quality.
* **Data Ingestion Strategy:** Determine the optimal method for consuming the data and establish a clear data storage strategy.
* **Data Analysis and Structuring:** Analyze the data to identify key business entities, including fact tables, dimension tables, and any necessary reference tables, to support the reporting objectives.

**Phase 2: Data Transformation and Modeling**

* **Data Transformation (Power Query):** Apply data cleansing best practices, utilizing Power Query to remove unwanted columns and transform the data as needed for analysis.
* **BI Data Modeling:** Establish relationships between all data tables and create a robust data model. This includes developing a measure table to house all key metrics and calculated measures.

**Phase 3: Reporting and Deployment**

* **Report Development:** Design and implement professional charts, visualizations, and interactive reports to effectively present the data to stakeholders.
* **Solution Deployment:** Deploy the completed reports and the underlying data model to Power BI Services, making the solution accessible for end-user consumption.
