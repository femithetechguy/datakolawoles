### Implementation Plan: End-to-End Business Intelligence Solution

The development of the business intelligence solution will proceed through the following systematic phases:

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition & Initial Analysis**

* **Data Source Assessment:** Conduct a thorough analysis of all source data systems to understand their structure, content, and quality.
* **Data Ingestion Strategy:** Define the optimal method for data consumption and determine the appropriate data storage solution, such as a Data Warehouse (DW).
* **Data Structuring Analysis:** Analyze the data to identify and define the key business entities, including fact tables, dimension tables, and any necessary reference tables.

**Phase 2: Data Warehousing & Transformation**

* **ETL Process:** Develop and implement an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process, utilizing a tool like SSIS, to move and prepare data for loading into the Data Warehouse.
* **Optional - Tabular Modeling:** Based on project requirements for enhanced performance, a multi-dimensional or tabular model may be developed in SSAS to support complex business queries.

**Phase 3: BI Modeling & Reporting**

* **Data Preparation (Power Query):** Apply data cleansing and transformation best practices to refine the data, which includes removing unnecessary columns and ensuring data integrity.
* **BI Data Modeling:** Build a robust data model within Power BI by establishing relationships between tables and creating a comprehensive measure table for key metrics.
* **Report Development:** Design and create professional charts, visualizations, and interactive reports to meet business requirements and provide actionable insights.

**Phase 4: Solution Deployment**

* **Deployment:** The completed data model and reports will be published to Power BI Services, making the solution available to stakeholders for consumption and analysis.
