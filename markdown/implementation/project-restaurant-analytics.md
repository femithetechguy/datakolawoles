### Implementation Plan: End-to-End Business Intelligence Solution

The implementation of the business intelligence solution will be executed through the following phased methodology:

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Warehousing**

* **Data Source Understanding:** A thorough analysis of the source systems will be conducted to understand the data structure, relationships, and quality.
* **Data Consumption Strategy:** A decision on the optimal method for consuming data and the appropriate data storage solution will be made.
* **Data Analysis:** Data will be analyzed to identify and define key business entities, including fact tables, dimension tables, and any necessary reference tables.
* **ETL Process:** An Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process will be developed, utilizing a tool like SSIS, to load the transformed data into the Data Warehouse (DW).

**Phase 2: Data Modeling and Analytics**

* **Data Preparation (Power Query):** Best practices will be applied to prepare the data, including the removal of unwanted columns, ensuring data cleanliness and efficiency.
* **BI Data Modeling:** Relationships between tables will be established and a robust data model will be created. This includes the development of key measures and calculated metrics to support business analysis.
* **Optional - Tabular Modeling:** The implementation of SSAS Tabular cubes will be considered for enhanced performance and complex query handling, subject to project requirements.

**Phase 3: Reporting and Deployment**

* **Report Development:** Professional charts, visualizations, and interactive reports will be designed and built in Power BI to present key business insights.
* **Solution Deployment:** The completed data model and reports will be deployed to Power BI Services, making the solution available to end-users for consumption.
