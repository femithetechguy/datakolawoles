### Implementation Plan: Data Analytics Development

The implementation of the data analytics solution will follow a phased and structured approach to ensure a robust and effective outcome. The process is outlined below:

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition & Preparation**

This phase focuses on the foundational steps required to prepare the data for analysis.

* **Understanding Data Source:** Conduct a comprehensive review of the source data to understand its structure, content, and quality.
* **Data Consumption Strategy:** Determine the optimal method for data consumption and decide on the appropriate data storage solution.
* **Data Analysis & Structuring:** Analyze the data to identify and define the key elements, including fact tables, dimension tables, and any necessary reference tables.
* **Data Transformation (Power Query):** Apply best practices within Power Query to cleanse the data, which includes removing unwanted columns and performing necessary transformations to ensure data integrity.

**Phase 2: Data Modeling & Visualization**

This phase involves building the data model and designing the user-facing reports.

* **Data Modeling (Power BI):** Establish relationships between tables and create a robust data model. This includes developing a measure table to store all key performance indicators (KPIs) and calculated metrics.
* **Report Development:** Design and build interactive charts and visualizations within Power BI Reports to present the data in a clear and actionable format.

**Phase 3: Solution Deployment**

This final phase focuses on the publication and deployment of the completed solution.

* **Deployment (Power BI Services):** Deploy the finalized reports and data models to Power BI Services, making the solution accessible to the end-users.
