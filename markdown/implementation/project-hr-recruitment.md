### Implementation Plan: HR Recruitment Analysis | Flat file to star schema

This document provides a phased implementation plan to meet project requirements.

The implementation will follow a structured, phased approach, integrating data architecture best practices into the development process.

#### **Phase 1: Planning and Data Analysis**

* **Objective:** To understand existing reports, define the scope, and analyze the underlying data sources.
* **Steps:**
    1.  **Understand Existing Reports:** Conduct a thorough review of current reports and business needs to define project objectives.
    2.  **Understand Data Source:** Analyze source systems to understand data structures, quality, and potential for consumption.
    3.  **Plan Data Model:** Develop a plan to transform the existing flat data models into a star schema, identifying fact tables, dimension tables, and any necessary reference tables.

#### **Phase 2: Data Transformation & Modeling**

* **Objective:** To cleanse the data and build a robust data model for reporting.
* **Steps:**
    1.  **Data Ingestion & Transformation:** Determine the optimal method for consuming data and utilize tools like Power Query to implement best practices, including removing unwanted columns and performing necessary data cleaning.
    2.  **Data Modeling:** Implement the planned star schema by establishing relationships between all fact and dimension tables. This phase includes the creation of a measure table to house all key metrics and calculations.

#### **Phase 3: Reporting & Deployment**

* **Objective:** To develop and deploy reports and dashboards to meet the defined business requirements.
* **Steps:**
    1.  **Report Development:** Design and create professional reports and visualizations in Power BI to present the required analyses (Loan Disbursement, Vendor/Customer Ageing).
    2.  **Deployment:** Deploy the finalized reports and data models to the Power BI Service, making the solution accessible to end-users for consumption.
